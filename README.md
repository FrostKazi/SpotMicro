# Spot Micro â€” Doggi Don

Well, made one for college's Capstone Project, a short blog-like documentation for the works.

**Live site (cuz why not xD):** `https://FrostKazi.github.io/SpotMicro/`

Offical - `https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`
Project Based On MichaelKubina Designs - `https://github.com/michaelkubina/SpotMicroESP32`
& Runeharlyk Build - `https://github.com/runeharlyk/SpotMicroESP32-Leika`
Check them out, they have done an awesome job in keeping up the development for hobbyists.

## My Twist
Since I needed my build to be portable via airplanes, we cannot use LiPo batteries or the works. Thus, I settled on using an old SMPS & run the Dog off the wall. 
With no worries for the power regulation inside the dog, it saved up quite some space & complexity for internals. Used a small powerbank to power the ESP Xiao (brains) & let the servos run off the mains.
